            "Mercury likes to keep things simple.\r\n\r\nThis small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, " +
            "so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. A year on Mercury goes by fast. " +
            "Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take very long to go all the way around. It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. " +

            "It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the Sun. That means that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on Venus.",
            Paragraph3 = "Since the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth. Here, the Sun rises and sets once each day. " +
            "But on Venus, the Sun rises every 117 Earth days. That means the Sun rises two times during each year on Venus, even though it is still the same day on Venus! " +
