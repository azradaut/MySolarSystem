            "Nearest the Sun are four fairly small, rocky planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.\r\n\r\nBeyond Mars is the asteroid belt – a region populated by millions of rocky objects. " +
            "These are left-overs from the formation of the planets, 4.5 billion years ago.\r\n\r\nOn the far side of the asteroid belt are the four gas giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. " +
            "These planets are much bigger than Earth, but very lightweight for their size. They are mostly made of hydrogen and helium.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, the furthest known planet was an icy world called Pluto. " +
            "However, Pluto is dwarfed by Earth’s Moon and many astronomers think it is too small to be called a true planet.\r\n\r\nAn object named Eris, which is at least as big as Pluto, was discovered very far from the Sun in 2005. " +
            "More than 1,000 icy worlds such as Eris have been discovered beyond Pluto in recent years. These are called Kuiper Belt Objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical " +
            "Union decided that Pluto and Eris must be classed as “dwarf planets”.\r\n\r\nEven further out are the comets of the Oort Cloud. These are so far away that they are invisible in even the largest telescopes. " +
            "Every so often one of these comets is disturbed and heads towards the Sun. It then becomes visible in the night sky."

            "It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. If you lived on Mercury, you’d have a birthday every three months!\r\n\r\nA day on Mercury is not like a day here" +

            " It has mountains and volcanoes. Venus is similar in size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger.\r\n\r\nVenus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of " +
            "Earth and most other planets. And its rotation is very slow. It takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once. Because it's so close to the Sun, a year goes by fast. " +
            "It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the Sun. That means that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on Venus.\r\n\r\nSince the day and year " +
            "lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth. Here, the Sun rises and sets once each day. But on Venus, the Sun rises every 117 Earth days. " +
            "That means the Sun rises two times during each year on Venus, even though it is still the same day on Venus! And because Venus rotates backwards, the Sun " +

            "They’re made of chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.\r\n\r\nWhen Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was seeing. " +
            "At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we know those \"handles\" turned out to be the rings of Saturn.\r\n\r\n Saturn, has been recognized since ancient times due to " +
